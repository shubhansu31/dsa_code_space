# Encode and Decode TinyURL

### Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.


## Java

~~~public class Codec {

    Map<String, String> urlMap;

    public Codec() {
        urlMap = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public String encode(String originalUrl) {

        String newUrl = Long.toString(originalUrl.hashCode(), 16);
        urlMap.put(newUrl, originalUrl);        
        return newUrl;
    }   

    public String decode(String newUrl) {
        return urlMap.get(newUrl);  
    }   
}
