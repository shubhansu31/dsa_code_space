# Maximum Frequency Stack

mplement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

### FreqStack has two functions:

* push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
* pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
  * If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.


* Example 1:

~~~
Input: 
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].
~~~

## Note

~~~Calls to FreqStack.push(int x) will be such that 0 <= x <= 10^9.
It is guaranteed that FreqStack.pop() won't be called if the stack has zero elements.
The total number of FreqStack.push calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
The total number of FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
The total number of FreqStack.push and FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 150000 across all test cases.

```class FreqStack {
    
    private HashMap<Integer , Integer > freq ;
    private HashMap<Integer , Stack<Integer> > group;
    private int maxFreq;

    public FreqStack() {
        freq = new HashMap<>();
        group = new HashMap<>();
        maxFreq = 0;
        
    }
    
    public void push(int x) {
        int f = freq.getOrDefault(x , 0) + 1;
        freq.put(x , f);
        if(f > maxFreq )
            maxFreq = f;
        Stack<Integer> st = group.getOrDefault(f , new Stack<Integer>());
        st.push(x);
        group.put(f,st);
    }
    
    public int pop() {
        int x = group.get(maxFreq).pop();
        freq.put(x , freq.get(x) - 1);
        if(group.get(maxFreq).size() == 0){
            group.remove(maxFreq);
            maxFreq--;
        }
        return x;
    }
}
